# Open Access and Open Data Policy

## Executive Summary
EDTECH-ID is committed to advancing global knowledge through comprehensive open access and open data practices that align with international standards and best practices. This policy establishes our framework for maximizing the accessibility, impact, and reusability of research outputs while maintaining the highest standards of academic integrity and ethical responsibility.

## Purpose and Scope
To promote transparency, collaboration, and wider dissemination of research findings, data, and educational resources developed by EDTECH-ID, ensuring that they are accessible to the global research community, policymakers, educators, and the public. This policy applies to all research activities, publications, datasets, software, and educational materials produced under EDTECH-ID's auspices.

## Guiding Principles

### Transparency and Accessibility
EDTECH-ID believes that publicly funded research should be publicly accessible, contributing to the global commons of knowledge and fostering innovation in educational technology.

### Scientific Integrity
All open access practices will maintain the highest standards of peer review, quality assurance, and academic rigor expected of international research institutions.

### Equity and Inclusion
Open access removes financial and institutional barriers to knowledge, promoting equitable access to research findings regardless of geographic location or institutional affiliation.

### FAIR Data Principles
All data sharing practices will adhere to FAIR principles: Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable.

## Open Access Publications

### Mandatory Open Access
- **Gold Open Access**: All peer-reviewed research articles, conference papers, and scholarly publications will be published in open access journals or through institutional repositories immediately upon publication.
- **Green Open Access**: When publishing in subscription-based journals, authors must deposit the accepted manuscript in an institutional repository within 6 months of publication.
- **Diamond Open Access**: EDTECH-ID prioritizes publication venues that provide open access without author fees when possible.

### Publication Standards
- All publications must undergo rigorous peer review processes consistent with international academic standards.
- Publications will include comprehensive methodological documentation to enable reproducibility.
- Digital Object Identifiers (DOIs) will be assigned to all publications for permanent accessibility.
- Publications will be deposited in multiple repositories to ensure long-term preservation.

### Article Processing Charges (APCs)
- EDTECH-ID will maintain a dedicated fund to support open access publication fees.
- Preference will be given to journals with reasonable APC policies and transparent pricing structures.
- Negotiations with publishers will prioritize institutional agreements that reduce or eliminate APCs.

## Open Data Management

### Data Sharing Requirements
- **Research Data**: All research data supporting published findings must be made openly available within 12 months of publication, unless exempted under specific conditions.
- **Real-time Data**: Where feasible, data will be made available in real-time through APIs and live dashboards.
- **Longitudinal Data**: Long-term datasets will be maintained and updated regularly to support ongoing research.

### Data Standards and Formats
- Data will be provided in non-proprietary, machine-readable formats (CSV, JSON, XML, etc.).
- Comprehensive metadata will accompany all datasets using international standards (Dublin Core, DataCite, etc.).
- Data documentation will include detailed methodologies, variable definitions, and quality assessments.
- Version control will be implemented for all datasets with clear change logs.

### Data Repositories and Infrastructure
- Primary data will be deposited in domain-specific repositories recognized by the international research community.
- EDTECH-ID will maintain its own institutional data repository with robust search and discovery capabilities.
- Data will be mirrored across multiple repositories to ensure redundancy and accessibility.
- Integration with international data federations and research infrastructures will be pursued.

## Intellectual Property and Licensing

### Open Licensing Framework
- **Creative Commons Licensing**: All publications and educational materials will use Creative Commons licenses (preferably CC BY or CC BY-SA).
- **Data Licensing**: Research data will be released under CC0 (public domain) or CC BY licenses to maximize reusability.
- **Software Licensing**: Open source software will be released under OSI-approved licenses (MIT, GPL, Apache 2.0).

### Copyright and Attribution
- EDTECH-ID will retain copyright while granting broad usage rights through open licenses.
- Clear attribution requirements will be specified for all reused materials.
- Proper citation formats will be provided for all research outputs.

### Patent and Commercialization Policy
- Inventions with commercial potential will be evaluated for patent protection before open disclosure.
- Licensing agreements for patented technologies will include provisions for academic and research use.
- Revenue from commercialization will support further open access initiatives.

## Quality Assurance and Peer Review

### International Peer Review Standards
- All research outputs will undergo rigorous peer review by international experts in relevant fields.
- Transparent peer review processes will be implemented where appropriate.
- Post-publication peer review and community feedback will be encouraged and facilitated.

### Research Integrity
- All research will adhere to international standards for research integrity and responsible conduct.
- Data management plans will be required for all research projects.
- Regular audits of open access compliance will be conducted.

## Exceptions and Restricted Access

### Legitimate Restrictions
- **Privacy and Confidentiality**: Data containing personally identifiable information or sensitive institutional data.
- **National Security**: Research with potential security implications following relevant national guidelines.
- **Commercial Partnerships**: Third-party agreements that require temporary access restrictions.
- **Ethical Considerations**: Research involving vulnerable populations or sensitive topics.

### Embargo Periods
- Maximum embargo periods will be clearly defined (typically 6-12 months for publications, 12-24 months for data).
- Justifications for embargoes will be documented and reviewed annually.
- Metadata and abstracts will remain immediately accessible even during embargo periods.

### Access on Request
- For restricted datasets, a clear process for requesting access will be established.
- Data access committees will review requests within 30 days.
- Criteria for access approval will be transparent and consistently applied.

## International Collaboration and Interoperability

### Global Partnerships

Open Access and Open Data Policy
Purpose: To promote transparency, collaboration, and wider dissemination of research findings, data, and educational resources developed by EDTECH-ID, ensuring that they are accessible to the global research community and the public.

Key Provisions:

Open Access:

EDTECH-ID is committed to making all of its research outputs, publications, and educational materials freely available to the public through open access platforms. This includes research papers, reports, datasets, and any other resources that can contribute to the body of knowledge in educational technology.

All research funded by public grants or donations will be published under open access terms, unless otherwise specified by the funding body or if there are concerns related to security, confidentiality, or ethical considerations.

Data Accessibility:

EDTECH-ID will make its research data openly accessible through open data repositories in accordance with established standards for data sharing, privacy, and security.

All datasets will be accompanied by comprehensive metadata, ensuring that the data is properly documented and can be reused by other researchers. This documentation will include clear explanations of data formats, methodologies, and any limitations on data usage.

Licensing and Copyright:

Research outputs and data made available through EDTECH-IDâ€™s open access platforms will be published under open licenses (e.g., Creative Commons licenses), allowing for the free use, adaptation, and distribution of content, provided appropriate attribution is given.

EDTECH-ID will retain copyright for its published works but will allow others to freely use and redistribute content under the terms of the applicable open license.

Exceptions to Open Access:

In some cases, EDTECH-ID may restrict open access to certain research outputs, particularly if there are legal, ethical, or commercial considerations (e.g., intellectual property rights, privacy issues, or third-party agreements).

Any exceptions to open access will be clearly stated in the publication or data set, along with an explanation for the restriction. These exceptions will be reviewed periodically to determine if the restrictions can be lifted.

Collaboration and Partnerships:

EDTECH-ID encourages collaborations with other institutions, researchers, and organizations to further the dissemination of open access research.

Collaborative research projects will adhere to open access and open data principles, with clear agreements on data sharing, publication, and attribution prior to the commencement of the project.

Ethics and Integrity:

EDTECH-ID ensures that open access and open data practices are aligned with ethical research practices, particularly regarding sensitive data, privacy concerns, and the protection of vulnerable populations.

Any data or research outputs that involve human participants will undergo ethical review and comply with relevant ethical standards before being made publicly available.

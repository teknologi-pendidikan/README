Conflict of Interest Policy
Purpose
The purpose of this Conflict of Interest Policy is to protect the integrity of the decision-making process at Teknologi Pendidikan ID (EDTECH-ID) and to ensure that the organization’s activities are carried out in a transparent, impartial, and ethical manner. This policy provides guidelines to identify and address conflicts of interest that could compromise the credibility or trust in the organization’s operations, research, and partnerships.

Scope
This policy applies to all members of EDTECH-ID, including but not limited to the Board of Directors, management team, researchers, staff, consultants, volunteers, and any others engaged in decision-making or advisory roles within the organization.

Definition of Conflict of Interest
A conflict of interest arises when an individual’s personal interests, relationships, or activities could influence, or appear to influence, their professional judgment, responsibilities, or actions within EDTECH-ID. This includes any situation where the individual’s private interests may conflict with the public interest or the interests of EDTECH-ID.

Examples of Conflicts of Interest
Financial Interests: An individual has a financial interest (e.g., ownership, investment, or financial gain) in a company, organization, or entity that stands to benefit or suffer from a decision made by EDTECH-ID.

Personal Relationships: A member of the organization has a personal or familial relationship with an individual or entity that may be affected by the actions or decisions of EDTECH-ID.

Outside Employment or Commitments: An individual has outside employment, consulting, or other commitments that may conflict with their responsibilities to EDTECH-ID or affect their impartiality in decision-making.

Gifts or Benefits: Receiving gifts, services, or benefits from a third party that could influence or appear to influence the individual’s actions or decisions within the organization.

Research and Funding Conflicts: A researcher or staff member is involved in a project or research study where the funding, partners, or results could present a conflict with the objectives or integrity of EDTECH-ID.

Disclosure of Conflicts
All individuals covered by this policy must disclose any potential or actual conflicts of interest to the organization.

Disclosure Process:

The individual must provide a written statement outlining the nature of the conflict and any relevant details.

Disclosures should be made at the earliest opportunity and updated annually or whenever there is a change in the circumstances of the conflict.

Disclosures should be submitted to the Board of Directors or an assigned ethics committee, as appropriate.

Managing Conflicts of Interest
When a conflict of interest is disclosed, EDTECH-ID will take appropriate steps to manage or resolve the situation. Possible actions include:

Recusal: The individual may be asked to recuse themselves from discussions, decisions, or votes related to the matter.

Reassignment: The individual may be reassigned to different duties or projects where the conflict does not arise.

Monitoring: In some cases, additional monitoring or oversight may be required to ensure the conflict does not affect the organization’s activities.

Termination of Relationship: In extreme cases, where the conflict cannot be adequately managed, EDTECH-ID may terminate the individual’s involvement in the organization.

Prohibited Actions
It is prohibited for any individual covered by this policy to use their position within EDTECH-ID for personal gain or to influence decisions in ways that would be detrimental to the organization or its stakeholders.

Engaging in activities or relationships that create or may create a conflict of interest without disclosing them is a violation of this policy.

Annual Conflict of Interest Statement
Each year, all members of EDTECH-ID must sign a statement affirming that they have read, understood, and agree to comply with this Conflict of Interest Policy.

Any conflicts of interest that arise throughout the year must be reported immediately.

Confidentiality
All disclosures and actions taken regarding conflicts of interest will be treated with confidentiality to the extent possible while maintaining transparency and accountability.

Consequences of Violating the Policy
Violations of this policy may result in disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment, partnership, or volunteer status with EDTECH-ID.

Review and Amendments
This policy will be reviewed annually by the Board of Directors or Ethics Committee to ensure its effectiveness and relevance. EDTECH-ID reserves the right to amend the policy as needed to reflect best practices and changing legal or ethical standards.

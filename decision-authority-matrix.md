## Notes on Implementation

1. **Decision Escalation:** When disagreement occurs at any level, the decision should be escalated to the next authority level.

2. **Delegation:** Authority holders may delegate specific decisions but retain accountability.

3. **Documentation:** All significant decisions must be documented with rationale, participants, and outcomes.

4. **Review Process:** This matrix should be reviewed annually or when significant organizational changes occur.

5. **Emergency Decisions:** In emergencies, decision-makers may act with expedited approval processes but must document and notify appropriate parties as soon as possible.

6. **Decision Conflicts:** When conflicts arise between parallel authority holders, the next higher level of authority will resolve the conflict.

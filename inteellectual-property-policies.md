Intellectual Property Policies
IP Ownership and Transfer Policy
Purpose: To clearly define the ownership, management, and transfer of intellectual property (IP) generated from EDTECH-ID's research and development activities, ensuring that the organization maintains control over its innovations while fostering collaboration.

Key Provisions:

IP Ownership:

All intellectual property generated by EDTECH-ID, including research findings, software, technological innovations, and educational materials, shall be owned by EDTECH-ID unless otherwise specified by a written agreement.

The ownership of IP created in partnership with external organizations or funded by grants will be governed by the terms of the partnership or grant agreements.

Joint Ownership:

In cases where intellectual property is created jointly by EDTECH-ID and external collaborators, ownership rights will be shared as per the agreement made between the parties involved, specifying each partyâ€™s rights and obligations regarding the use, commercialization, and distribution of the IP.

Technology Transfer:

EDTECH-ID will establish a formal process for technology transfer to external entities, including universities, companies, and non-profit organizations.

The transfer will be governed by licensing agreements, including details on royalties, usage rights, and commercialization.

Any IP resulting from public funding will be subject to open access or non-exclusive licensing agreements unless justified otherwise due to specific conditions (e.g., security, public policy).

Commercialization:

In cases where EDTECH-ID determines that commercialization of its IP is appropriate, the organization will pursue commercialization through licensing, spin-offs, or other market-based mechanisms.

EDTECH-ID will enter into clear licensing agreements with commercial entities, ensuring that such agreements benefit the organization, support its mission, and respect ethical standards.

Royalties and profits from commercialization will be shared according to a predefined revenue-sharing model. This model will ensure equitable distribution between EDTECH-ID and collaborators, if any.

Revenue Sharing:

If commercialization of an innovation results in financial gain, EDTECH-ID will develop a transparent revenue-sharing model, which outlines the division of income from licensing or sales between EDTECH-ID and any contributing parties (e.g., researchers, development teams, external collaborators).

Revenue-sharing agreements will be outlined in licensing contracts, ensuring fair compensation for all parties involved.

IP Protection:

EDTECH-ID will take necessary steps to protect its intellectual property, including applying for patents, trademarks, copyrights, or other relevant protections where applicable.

EDTECH-ID will ensure that IP protection does not hinder the accessibility of its research outputs when they are critical to the open science and open access goals.

Dispute Resolution:

In the event of a dispute over IP ownership or commercialization, EDTECH-ID will follow a structured process for resolution, which may include internal review, mediation, and arbitration if needed.

External collaboration agreements will include clear dispute resolution mechanisms, which may include consultation, negotiation, or arbitration procedures.
